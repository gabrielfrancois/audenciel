FAQ

Why did my submission fail?

Have a look at the logs on Codabench.
If your submission fails on Codabench, don't panic, review the logs! You can access them via the Codabench user interface:
1. Go to the "Submission" tab and scroll to the end of the page to find your submission.
2. Click on the row corresponding to your submission.
3. Select the "Logs" tab.
4. Browse the various types of logs available: stdout, stderr, Ingestion stdout, and Ingestion stderr, for both the ingestion and scoring steps.

How to configure my environment?

Try interactive docker or conda environment, it is especially useful for python users!

A conda environment is provided. Follow these steps to install and activate it. Retrieve the file env_final_pyr.yml from GitHub as follows:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielfrancois/audensiel/refs/heads/main/environment/env_final_pyr.yml
conda env create -f env_final_pyr.yml && conda activate audensiel

To run the docker interactively you can run:

## for the python version
sudo docker run -it -v .:/audensiel -w /audensiel hgabrielfrancois/audensiel python
import submission_script

Due to the usage of the super user (sudo) all files created by docker will be owned by root. In order to retrieve ownership, you can use this command:

sudo chown -R $USER submissions

Beware that Mac users with M1 processors might encounter problems.

How to run submissions ingestion and scoring locally with Docker?

To speed up the debugging process and avoid the full submission workflow, you can run your submission program locally using FAKE data. The fake data serves two purposes: first, it allows testing without relying on the actual scoring program (which requires the ground truth), and second, it speeds up computation.

To test locally, follow these steps:

# Clone the challenge repository:
git clone https://github.com/gabrielfrancois/audensiel.git
cd audensiel

# Set up the environment and activate it:
conda env create -f environment-r.yml && conda activate audensiel

# Run the automated Docker test script:
sh automated_docker_test.sh

Please note that this script will use the submission_script.py from the starting_kit/ folder. 
Ensure that your script is placed inside the starting_kit/ folder or modify the existing script at starting_kit/submission_script.py.

The script automated_docker_test.sh first executes the py submission script locally, then re-executes it within the Docker container (ingestion phase), followed by running the scoring program.

If you wish to test each step independently or run the Python script locally, refer to the README.md in the audensiel GitHub repository (https://github.com/gabrielfrancois/audensiel).

How to include an external file to be used in the submission script?

It is possible to include an external file that is sourced in the submission script and correctly included in the zip file to be submitted on the Codabench platform.

Beware, when unzipped the file 'program.py' has to be on the current directory and not inside a folder. Additional files can be located in other folders with the correct relative path.
