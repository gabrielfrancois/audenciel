# Evaluation and Scoring   
                           
The **global score** is used to rank the different methods and is computed from the estimated proportion matrix. This score is a combination of several metrics measuring the accuracy of the estimations of the presence of anomalies and their classifications compared to the real ones.: Pearson and Spearman correlations on the total matrix, on the columns (samples correlations) and on the rows (cell types correlations), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Aitchison distance. The combination is a weighted geometric mean, such that all correlations account for one third, all errors for a second third and the distance for the last third of the global score.
